	<p>My name is Luke Anderton, and I am from Baytown, Texas. I am currently attending Texas A&M in pursuit of my bachelor's in Geographic Information Sciences and Technologies on the Computation, Design, and Analysis Track, set to graduate in May of 2020. I have focused my studies on learning and utilizing GIS systems, as well as increasing my experience as a programming professional. I am currently well versed in most GIS and remote sensing systems, and have done projects revolving around using remote sensing, LIDAR, ESRI products and open source data acquisition. I have taken classes covering remote sensing, GIS technology, ArcPython, data structures, and programming languages. I also have experience with other programs such as Unity, GameMaker Studio 2, Github, Slack, and Microsoft Office.  </p>
