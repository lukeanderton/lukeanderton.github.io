	<p>My name is Luke Anderton, and I am from Baytown, Texas. I am currently attending Texas A&M in pursuit of my bachelor's in Geographic Information Sciences and Technologies on the Computation, Design, and Analysis Track, set to graduate in May of 2020. I have focused my studies on learning and utilizing GIS systems, as well as increasing my experience as a programming professional. I am currently in GIS systems such as ENVI, ArcMap and ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS Online and others. I also have in depth experience coding in c++ and java, and limited experience with c, c#, python, html and css, scheme, R, and Visual Basic. I have taken classes covering remote sensing, programming using ArcPython, data structures, and programming languages. </p>
